# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview
This analysis was done to determine the number of retiring employees in each given job title and identify which employees are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. The data will be used to help prepare management for the "silver tsunami" as many current employees reach retirement age. 

### Results
- The senior positions have the largest number of retiring employees. There are 25,916 retiring Senior Engineers and 24,926 retiring Senior Staff
- There are only 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program, which is significantly less than the amount of retiring employees 
- Out of the 9 managers, 2 are eligible for retirement 
- There are over 70,000 employees within retirement eligiblity 

#### Summary
As the "silver trsunami" begins to make an impact, there are 72,458 roles that will need to be filled.

There are enough qualified (1,549), retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees but the company will need to start hiring immediately.
